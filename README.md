# nicknamebot

Zac - run the test_insert_user.py file

What I need help with:
1. How do my sql commands look? Am I doing anything that could cause issues I'm not aware of?
2. Project architecture/structure -  nicknamebot.py file won't run without experiencing import errors. the test_insert_user.py file runs fine using the same imports, i'm obviously doing something wrong here just not sure what
